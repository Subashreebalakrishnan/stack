   <div> <p>Currently, we are using reactjs in our webapp and we are using default icons from ant design, we have a new Icon design and I already added the SVG icons in the Public folder. The problem is I can’t add my local icons from the public folder to routes.ts where the navigation menus are located. I tried adding the file path of the icons value icon: “../dashboard_poker_cards.svg” (Please see attached screenshot of javascript object menu). I tried a different way of adding the file path in the value of the icon but still won’t show the local icon</p>
